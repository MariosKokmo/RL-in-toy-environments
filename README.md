# RL-in-toy-environments

This projects consists of simple toy-worlds for RL agents that have been constructed from scratch. The RL agent will try each time to find the optimal strategy implementing various algorithms.
The 2D grid worlds allow for 4 discrete actions, while returning a reward that is chosen by the user at each instantiation of the problem.
